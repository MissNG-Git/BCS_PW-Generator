# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This application was created to generate a random password based on criteria a user has selected by modifying a starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the included JavaScript code. I have tried to keep the user interface clean, polished and responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If youâ€™re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## Objectives

```
+ Randomly generate a password that meets certain user-reqeusted criteria
+ Generate passwords to be inclusive of special characters (OWASP Foundation) where reqeusted
+ Allow for users to create strong passwords for greater account security
+ Ensure user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate by providing a clean & polished look.


```

## Target Design

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

### Overview of Code Functionality

1. Application's "Generate Password" button function correctly.

2. Application's 'prompt' feature successfully creates pop-up to request password criteria.

3. Application's criteria parameters are set to be a minimum of 8 characters long but no more than 128 characters maximum.

4. Application accurately registers user input for password criteria (ie lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters), and validates response to include in generated password.

5. Application successfully generates a password that matches the selected criteria and displays the password on the page, free of errors at the front (on-screen to user) or back-end (in console) of web page.

### Usability

* Click on "Generate Password."

* Enter password criteria when prompted (*ie lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters*).

* Password will be generated and displayed directly on web page for you to note or copy/paste into desired application/website :)

* **NOTE:** Minimum length of password is 8 characters and Maximum length is 128 characters.
